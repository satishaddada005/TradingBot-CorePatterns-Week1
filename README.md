   if (rollingWindow.Count < 20)
       return SignalType.None; // Not enough data yet

   double emaFast = CalculateEMA(rollingWindow.TakeLast(9));
   double emaSlow = CalculateEMA(rollingWindow.TakeLast(21));
   double rsi = CalculateRSI(rollingWindow.TakeLast(14));

   if (emaFast > emaSlow && rsi < 30)

Final Quick Question for you:

Would you also like me to suggest a few realistic Nifty 50 stocks to paper trade while you test this bot later? (like safest + liquid ones).
Can give a starter watchlist too!
Want it?
 
 
Awesome — commitment is everything.
Let’s kick off Week 1 systematically:
I’ll walk you through what exactly to do today to complete the Week 1 module.

⸻

WEEK 1: Object-Oriented Design + SOLID Foundations

⸻

1. Goal for Week 1

Understand and implement:
   • Interfaces
   • Dependency Inversion
   • Single Responsibility Principle
   • IDisposable (Resource management)
   • Build 3 mini projects:
     • Logger system
     • Event system
     • IDisposable resource manager

⸻

2. Today’s Setup Checklist

You should have this ready before you start coding:

Task Description Done?
Create GitHub Repo Name: TradingBot-CorePatterns-Week1 ⬜
Setup Solution Solution name: CorePatterns.sln ⬜
Setup Console App Project name: CorePatterns.ConsoleApp (.NET 8 preferred) ⬜
Create Folders /Logger, /Events, /Resources inside project ⬜
Setup Git Ignore Use default Visual Studio gitignore (to avoid bin/obj) ⬜



⸻

3. Tasks to Complete for Week 1

⸻

Module 1: Logger System (Interface + DIP Principle)

What to Build:
• An ILogger interface:

public interface ILogger
{
   void Log(string message);
}


• Two concrete classes:
• ConsoleLogger (logs to Console)
• FileLogger (logs to a .txt file)
• Create a class Application that depends on ILogger, not on a specific logger class.

Design Tip:
Don’t directly create new ConsoleLogger() inside Application. Inject via constructor!

⸻

Module 2: Event System (Delegate + Event Handling)

What to Build:
• A Notifier class that:
• Exposes an event OnNotify
• Can trigger event with a message
• A Subscriber class that:
• Subscribes to Notifier event
• Logs received messages

Rough structure:

public class Notifier
{
   public event Action<string> OnNotify;

   public void Send(string message)
   {
       OnNotify?.Invoke(message);
   }	
}

public class Subscriber
{
   public void Subscribe(Notifier notifier)
   {
       notifier.OnNotify += (msg) => Console.WriteLine($"Received: {msg}");
   }
}



⸻

Module 3: IDisposable Implementation (Resource Management)

What to Build:
• A class DatabaseConnection that:
• Implements IDisposable
• Has methods Open(), Close()
• Releases unmanaged resources properly when disposed

Sample skeleton:

public class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
{
   private bool _disposed = false;

   public void Open()
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Connection opened.");
   }

   public void Close()
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Connection closed.");
   }

   public void Dispose()
   {
       if (!_disposed)
       {
           Close();
           _disposed = true;
       }
   }
}

Design Tip:
Use Dispose() manually or with using statement.

⸻

4. Folder Structure for Week 1

/CorePatterns.ConsoleApp
   /Logger
       ILogger.cs
       ConsoleLogger.cs
       FileLogger.cs
       Application.cs
   /Events
       Notifier.cs
       Subscriber.cs
   /Resources
       DatabaseConnection.cs
Program.cs



⸻

5. Completion Checklist for Week 1

Task Success Criteria
Logger works Console and File Logging both tested
Event system works Sending and Receiving messages via event
IDisposable works Resource cleanup happens correctly
Single Responsibility principle respected Each class does only one job
Dependency Inversion respected High-level modules (Application) depend on abstractions (ILogger)



⸻

How Your Program.cs Should Look (Summary Demo)

class Program
{
   static void Main()
   {
       ILogger logger = new ConsoleLogger();
       Application app = new Application(logger);
       app.Run();

       Notifier notifier = new Notifier();
       Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();
       subscriber.Subscribe(notifier);

       notifier.Send("Event message: Trade Executed!");

       using (var connection = new DatabaseConnection())
       {
           connection.Open();
       }
   }
}



⸻

How to Work Today: Step-by-Step
1. Create GitHub repo and push basic solution
2. Create folder structure
3. Complete Logger system (test it)
4. Complete Event system (test it)
5. Complete Disposable resource system (test it)
6. Push changes to GitHub
7. (Optional) Write a README.md documenting Week 1 mini-projects

⸻

Tomorrow

Once this is complete, we’ll start:
• Refining code
• Adding unit tests
• Learning Dependency Injection frameworks

⸻

Would you like me to also give you:
• Small sample unit test example for Logger (to practice testing in C#)?
• A tiny README template to maintain your GitHub nicely from Day 1?

If yes, I’ll send that right after you complete the basic modules today!

⸻

Ready to begin?
You can start with Module 1: ILogger + ConsoleLogger + FileLogger.
